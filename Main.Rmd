## Action Needed by Francis (opened by Shreya)
@Franics - Please review updated versions in the Deliver.Rmd 

Also, one thing to may be consider in there is to check that we change before the particular date when this gre score system was used, irrespective of the system, we need to consider that well. - Thoughts on this Francis?

Could you please update when you have the regression thing you are working on and the data exploration part as well!

Following code is for your reference Francis - Since you showed interest in merging data. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
login$count <- 1
login2 <- login %>% group_by(identity) %>% summarize(sum(count))
```
```{r}
library(corrplot)
COR <- cor(gre) 
corrplot(COR, order="AOE", method="circle", tl.pos="lt", type="upper", tl.col="black", tl.cex=0.6, tl.srt=45, addCoef.col="black", addCoefasPercent = TRUE, sig.level=0.50, insig = "blank")
```


world map ->
```{r}
library("ggmap")
library(maptools)
library(maps)
visited <- unique(appbase$permanent_country)
ll.visited <- geocode(visited)
visit.x <- ll.visited$lon
visit.y <- ll.visited$lat
```

```{r}
map("world", fill=TRUE, col="white", bg="lightblue", ylim=c(-90,90))
points(visit.x,visit.y, col="red", pch=16)
```
Francis above is the world map until where I have completed so far. In case we dont get past this, we will skip it for this time and I will make sure I make a heat map for next time. But try if you can
